## üöÄ How to Run the Project

Getting the Recipe Book App up and running is a breeze! Follow these steps to dive into the code and start exploring recipes.

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.24.0 or later. Install it from flutter.dev.
- **Dart**: Comes bundled with Flutter.
- **Android Studio** or **VS Code**: For running the app and managing emulators.
- **Android/iOS Emulator** or **Physical Device**: For testing. I used the `sdk gphone64 x86 64` emulator during development.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-book-app.git
   cd recipe-book-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure your `pubspec.yaml` includes the following dependencies:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     flutter:
       sdk: flutter
     shared_preferences: ^2.3.0
     carousel_slider: ^5.1.1
     flutter_staggered_grid_view: ^0.7.0
     intl: ^0.20.2
     cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8
   dev_dependencies:
     flutter_test:
       sdk: flutter
     flutter_lints: ^6.0.0
   ```

   Run:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Add Assets**:

   - Create an `assets/images/` folder in the project root.
   - Add placeholder images (e.g., `egusi_soupjpg`, `jollof_rice.jpg`, `ewa.jpg`, `akara.jpg`, `banga_soup.jpg`, `moimoi.jpg`) for recipes and categories.
   - Update `pubspec.yaml` to include assets:

     ```yaml
     flutter:
       assets:
         - assets/images/
     ```

4. **Run the App**:

   - Start an emulator or connect a physical device.
   - Run:

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```
   - For debugging or detailed logs:

     ```bash
     flutter run --stacktrace
     ```

5. **Test the App**:

   - Run unit and widget tests:

     ```bash
     flutter test
     ```
   - Verify navigation, theme toggle, and responsiveness across mobile (width &lt; 600px), tablet (600px ‚â§ width &lt; 900px), and desktop (width ‚â• 900px).

6. **Build for Production** (Optional):

   - For Android:

     ```bash
     flutter build apk --release
     ```
   - For iOS:

     ```bash
     flutter build ios --release
     ```
   - See Flutter‚Äôs build and release docs for platform-specific setup (e.g., signing keys).

### Troubleshooting

- **NDK Issues**: If you see errors like `NDK did not have a source.properties file`, reinstall the NDK (e.g., version 27.0.12077973) via Android Studio‚Äôs SDK Manager.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Run `flutter pub outdated` and `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions` to resolve version conflicts.
- **Disk Space**: Ensure at least 5‚Äì10 GB of free space on your drive for builds.
- **Emulator Issues**: Verify your emulator is compatible (e.g., `sdk gphone64 x86 64`) and has sufficient resources.

## üé® Responsive Design Decisions

I wanted the Recipe Book App to feel right at home on any device, so I made some thoughtful design choices to ensure a consistent and delightful experience:

- **Breakpoints** (defined in `lib/utils/constants.dart`):
  - **Mobile** (&lt; 600px): Uses a white `BottomNavigationBar` for quick navigation and a drawer for additional options (e.g., theme toggle, favorites). The carousel and recipe cards are full-width for simplicity.
  - **Tablet** (600px‚Äì900px): Switches to a `NavigationRail` for a compact, side-by-side navigation layout, with a theme toggle button for easy access.
  - **Desktop** (‚â• 900px): Features a `NavigationDrawer` for a spacious, professional look, with the theme toggle at the bottom.
- **LayoutBuilder**: Used in `HomeScreen`, `RecipeDetailScreen`, and `ResponsiveNav` to dynamically adjust layouts based on screen width, ensuring responsiveness without hardcoding device types.
- **Carousel Slider**: Adjusts `viewportFraction` and `height` based on screen size (e.g., larger on desktop, smaller on mobile) for optimal visuals.
- **Theme Toggle**: Integrated into the drawer (mobile), `NavigationRail` (tablet), and `NavigationDrawer` (desktop) to maintain accessibility across layouts.
- **Typography and Spacing**: Leveraged `Theme.of(context).textTheme` and `AppConstants` (e.g., `defaultPadding`, `cardBorderRadius`) for consistent styling that adapts to light/dark themes.

These choices ensure the app is intuitive and visually appealing, whether you‚Äôre using a phone, tablet, or desktop.

## üõ†Ô∏è Challenges Faced and Solutions

Building the Recipe Book App wasn‚Äôt without its hiccups, but tackling these challenges made the app stronger! Here‚Äôs a rundown of the main issues I faced and how I solved them:

1. **NDK Build Error** (`source.properties` missing):

   - **Challenge**: The Android build failed with an error about a missing `source.properties` file in the NDK directory.
   - **Solution**: Reinstalled the NDK (version 27.0.12077973) via Android Studio‚Äôs SDK Manager, verified the `source.properties` file, and updated `android/build.gradle.kts` to reference the correct `ndkVersion`. Clearing the Gradle cache (`flutter clean`) also helped.

2. **CarouselController Conflict**:

   - **Challenge**: A naming conflict between `carousel_slider`‚Äôs `CarouselController` and Flutter‚Äôs Material `CarouselController` caused build errors after upgrading to Flutter 3.24.
   - **Solution**: Updated `carousel_slider` to version 5.1.1, which resolved the conflict. As a fallback, I could have used import aliases (e.g., `import 'package:carousel_slider/carousel_slider.dart' as carousel`), but the update was cleaner.

3. **Disk Space Error**:

   - **Challenge**: A `FileSystemException` occurred due to insufficient disk space when writing `app.dill`.
   - **Solution**: Freed up disk space (aiming for 5‚Äì10 GB), ran `flutter clean`, and cleared the Gradle cache. Moving the project to a drive with more space was an alternative option.

4. **Theme Toggle Not Working**:

   - **Challenge**: The theme toggle in the `HomeScreen` drawer failed because `context.findAncestorStateOfType` was unreliable for accessing `RecipeBookApp`‚Äôs state.
   - **Solution**: Passed a `VoidCallback onThemeToggle` from `main.dart` to `HomeScreen` via `ResponsiveNav`, allowing the drawer to directly call `_toggleTheme`. Persisted theme preferences using `SharedPreferences` via `StorageService`.

5. **Navigation Not Updating Screens**:

   - **Challenge**: The `BottomNavigationBar` was interactive but didn‚Äôt navigate to the correct screens because `ResponsiveNav`‚Äôs `child` was hardcoded to `HomeScreen`.
   - **Solution**: Restored the `_buildScreen` method in `main.dart` to dynamically select the screen based on `_selectedIndex`, ensuring navigation works across all layouts.

6. **Empty** `helpers.dart` **File**:

   - **Challenge**: The `helpers.dart` file was empty, serving no purpose in the codebase.
   - **Solution**: Added utility functions (`formatDuration`, `capitalize`, `isValidSearchQuery`, etc.) to `helpers.dart` for formatting and validation tasks. Alternatively, you can delete the file if unused.

These challenges taught me a lot about Flutter‚Äôs build system, dependency management, and state handling, making the app more robust and maintainable.
